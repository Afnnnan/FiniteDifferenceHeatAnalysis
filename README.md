# FiniteDifferenceHeatAnalysis


This repository hosts an implementation of the implicit finite difference method for analyzing temperature distribution across a wall. The method is applied to solve heat conduction problems with varying boundary conditions. The code provides a comprehensive framework for discretizing heat conduction equations, updating temperatures iteratively, and visualizing temperature variations over time. Additionally, the repository includes documentation on the algorithm, implementation details, and analysis of results. This project was completed as part of the MM218 Programming Assignment.
